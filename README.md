Introduction
The Final In-Class Assignment offers students the opportunity to apply their skills and knowledge in software development to enhance an existing application. The assignment is divided into three main options, each designed to challenge students and encourage creativity in different ways. Additionally, there is a list of potential feature ideas that students can choose from or propose their own. This precis provides an overview of the assignment, its options, and additional feature ideas.

Assignment Options
1. Wireframe and Prototype
Objective: Wireframe and prototype a new feature to add to the existing application. Students can choose from the provided options or propose an original feature. Before diving into wireframing and prototyping, create a detailed summary outlining the concept and objectives of the chosen feature.

2. HTML/CSS/JavaScript Implementation
Objective: Add a web page in HTML/CSS/JavaScript that represents the initial implementation of a feature intended for integration into the existing application. Students can select a feature from the provided list or suggest their own. Prior to implementation, provide a comprehensive summary describing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the feature and outline potential future revisions.

3. Single-Page Essay
Objective: Write a single-page essay assessing the existing application's viability and proposing improvements. This document should serve as a guide for the design and development team, both internally and in communication with the client. Include a section discussing the application's potential for community-building and propose features to enhance the current prototype.

Additional Feature Ideas
The assignment also provides a list of feature ideas for students to consider. These ideas can be chosen, and students should provide a summary for the feature they plan to work on. Here are some feature ideas:

Leaderboard Prototype
Objective: Create a dynamic and robust leaderboard prototype that displays top-scoring players, their high-scores, and relevant information about their in-game achievements. This feature enhances player competition and engagement.

Player's Dashboard
Objective: Design a comprehensive player dashboard that includes all essential options and information for players to effectively engage with the game. This dashboard should encompass a wide range of game dynamics options, improving the player experience.

Landing Page/Splash Screen
Objective: Prototype a captivating landing page or splash screen for the game, leveraging creativity to make a memorable first impression on players and potential users.

Comprehensive Readme
Objective: Construct an in-depth Readme file for the application, including a detailed summary that explains the game's mechanics thoroughly. This serves as a valuable resource for developers and users alike.

Main Game Screen Prototype
Objective: Design the main game screen, ensuring it includes links to other sections of the web page for seamless navigation within the game environment.

Animation Enhancement
Objective: Devise solutions to increase the amount of animation used in the game on any existing pages or a new page. This can enhance the user experience and add dynamic elements to the application.

Image Collection on GitHub
Objective: Continue adding to a collection of images, videos, or text in a public GitHub repository. This repository serves as a valuable resource for the project and promotes sharing in the public domain.

Blog Template Page
Objective: Create a page that serves as a template for a blog that will accompany the project in the future. This template will be included in a future revision of the project's main branch.

Trello Board Link
Objective: Include a link to a Trello board that tracks project progress, tasks, and collaboration efforts. This board helps streamline project management.

Google Docs Image Folder Link
Objective: Provide a link to a Google Docs folder containing a collection of images related to the project. This folder is a centralized resource for image assets.

Screencast Demo Link
Objective: Create a link to a YouTube video that demonstrates the application as a screencast, showcasing its current iteration with or without a voice-over. This video serves as a valuable visual presentation of the project.

Submission Requirements
To submit the assignment, students are required to compile all their work into a zipped folder. This folder should include completed features, prototypes, documents, and relevant links. Additionally, students should provide links to their Trello board, CodePen, and GitHub repositories for easy access and evaluation.
